                <ul>12 ounces grated Comté, Gruyère, or Emmentaler cheese</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    For the Spinach: Heat olive oil and butter in a large saucepan over 
                    medium heat until melted. Add shallots and garlic, season with salt 
                    and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and fragrant, 
                    about 1 minute. Add a few large handfuls of spinach and cook, stirring, 
                    until wilted. Continue adding spinach a handful at a time until it 
                    is all in the pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until spinach expels 
                    its moisture and most of that moisture evaporates, leaving a dry bottom 
                    as you stir. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Transfer spinach to a fine mesh strainer set over the sink and press 
                    out excess moisture with a rubber spatula. Let spinach continue to drain 
                    as you prepare the ricotta mixture.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    For the Ricotta: Transfer half of the ricotta, both eggs, the Parmesan, 
                    and the nutmeg to the bowl of a food processor. Season with salt and pepper. 
                    Process until completely smooth, about 1 minute.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Transfer mixture to a large bowl but do not wipe out food processor. 
                    Transfer spinach to food processor and pulse until finely chopped, 
                    10 to 12 short pulses. Add spinach and remaining ricotta to the 
                    ricotta mixture and fold gently to combine.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    For the White Sauce: Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat 
                    until melted. Add flour and increase heat to medium high. Cook, stirring 
                    butter and flour with a whisk until paled golden blond, about 1 minute. 
                    Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in milk. Continue to cook, whisking 
                    frequently, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Remove from heat 
                    and add 3/4 of mozzarella and Comté, Gruyère, or Emmenthale cheese. 
                    Whisk until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    To Assemble: Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven 
                    to 400°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta sheets 
                    a few at a time and cook until barely tender, about 45 seconds. Transfer 
                    to a fine mesh strainer and run under cool water until well chilled. 
                    Transfer to a clean kitchen towel in a single layer. Continue until all 
                    pasta is par-cooked and dried.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Drizzle a small amount of white sauce over the bottom of a lasagna pan or 
                    large casserole. Add a layer of noodles. Top with 1/12th of spinach mixture 
                    and 1/12th of remaining white sauce. Continue layering pasta, spinach, 
                    and white sauce until you lay down the top sheet of pasta.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Spread remaining spinach mixture evenly over the top. Sprinkle with 
                    remaining mozzarella and Comté or Emmentaler cheese and drizzle with 
                    remaining white sauce. Spread into an even layer with a rubber spatula.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and 
                    continue baking until bubble and lightly browned, about 20 minutes longer. 
                    Let rest at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes, then slice and serve.
                </ol>
